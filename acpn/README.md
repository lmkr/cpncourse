## Coloured Petri Nets for Concurrent Software Systems Engineering 

Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) is a high-level modelling language combining Petri Nets with a functional programming language. Petri Nets provides the formal foundation for graphical modelling of concurrency, synchronization, communication, and resource sharing while Standard ML is used to model data and capture sequential computations on data.  

The theory-tool module introduces the syntax and semantics of the CPN modelling language, and shows how CPN Tools can be used for editing, simulation, and validation of CPN models. The module will also cover hierarchical CPNs allowing models to be structured as a collection of modules with interfaces providing support for scalability, abstraction, and maintainability. Examples of CPN models from recent projects in the domain of smart software systems will be demonstrated. The case-study module will provide the participants with hands-on skills for constructing and simulating CPN models using CPN Tools using representative example systems. Participants may also choose to work on an example system of their own choice and interest.

## Lecturer

[Lars Michael Kristensen](https://www.hvl.no/en/employee/?user=Lars.Michael.Kristensen) is professor of computer science and software engineering at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), Campus Bergen. He holds a PhD degree in computer science from the University of Aarhus where he was a member of the Coloured Petri Nets Research Group that developed the CPN modelling language and the supporting CPN Tools. He has been involved in numerous projects on the application of CPN technology in collaboration with industry, including Nokia, Hewlett-Packard, Ericsson, Kongsberg, and Xylem. At HVL he has led the establishment of a PhD programme in computer science, and a master education in applied computer science and engineering. His current research interests are within IoT, embedded systems, cloud computing, and model-driven software engineering for development of smart software systems. He is co-investigator and work package leader in the Smart Ocean Centre for a research-based innovation funder by the Norwegian Research Council, member of the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences, and member of several international programme committees within distributed systems and concurrency.
